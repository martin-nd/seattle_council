Northeast Seattle) issued the following statement in response to the <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-police-chief-carmen-best-may-retire-amid-protests-city-council-cuts/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> by Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best that she plans to retire on September 2:</p>\n<p>“I am deeply saddened by the resignation of our Police Chief Carmen Best. Chief Best has served Seattle faithfully and honorably for decades and happens to be the first Black woman to serve as our City’s police chief. While a majority of City Council voted on August 5 to cut Carmen Best’s salary, it’s important to note that Councilmembers Juarez, Lewis, and I did NOT vote to cut her salary. </p>\n<p>“I did not support suddenly cutting the salary of the first Black police chief in Seattle’s history and the diverse, experienced team that she picked. While I believe we should take a hard look at reducing excessive city government pay during budget deficits, I believe our entire City Council should be more thoughtful and methodical so we avoid unintended consequences.  </p>\n<p>“There are few leaders better equipped than Carmen Best to help lead the hard negotiations needed to fix the police contract — today’s expensive and unreasonable police contract is among the biggest impediments to revamping and boosting public safety in all communities.  I will continue to work collaboratively with our Mayor and other colleagues to seek and implement solutions for Seattle, even though the road today is much more difficult.

The second hearing will be on November 1.\\nNext week the City Council’s Budget Committee will begin the Issue Identification portion of its review of the Mayor’s proposed 2018 budget, with meetings scheduled from October 12 to October 17. In these meetings, Council Central staff will raise issues for select departments regarding the proposed budget; Councilmembers can also raise issues (what has been called “Issue ID” during previous years).\\nA single Councilmember can raise an issue for discussion in staff memos and presentation before the Budget Committee. This is a new step introduced last year by Mayor Burgess during his time a chair of the Council’s Budget Committee; the deadline for Councilmembers to submit issues is noon on Monday, October 9.\\nHere’s a link to the Budget Committee schedule.\\n\\nAlki Public Safety and Health Survey Results\\n1100 people answered the Alki Public Safety and Health Survey. Thanks to all of you who responded.\\n620 replies were from Alki, and 197 from Admiral. In both neighborhoods, the biggest concern was Noise from Modified Vehicle Exhaust Systems.\\nProblems could be rated from 1-5, with 5 indicating the highest level of concern. Here’s the overall results:\\n\\n4.32 – Noise from Modified Vehicle Exhaust Systems\\n4.29 – Distracted Driving\\n4.13 – Speeding\\n4.04 – Noise from Vehicle Sound Systems\\n3.65 – Unmuffled Compression Braking Noise\\n3.65 – Cruising\\n3.46 – Vehicle Tire Noise\\n3.33 – Vehicle Idling\\n2.97 – Non-Visible Front and Rear License Plates\\n2.94 – Vehicle Window Tinting\\n\\nWe’ve put the survey results online here. You can click on neighborhoods for the specific breakdown for each of the categories in each neighborhood, along with a bar graph showing the distribution of results for each item.\\nWe’ve shared with the Seattle Police Department, and look forward to discussing these results and next steps with the community.\\n\\nFinal Design Review Update\\nOn Monday the Council voted unanimously for changes to the Design Review Program. Previously it was heard in the Planning, Land Use, and Zoning committee on each 8/1, 8/15, and 9/19 and there was a public hearing on 9/11.\\nHere is an update on the amendments that were made in committee that I sponsored that, taken together with our amendments sponsored by other Councilmembers, significantly changed the Executive’s proposal that I heard concerns about from many of you:\\nHere is a description of the changes I that I promoted by sponsoring amendments that successfully passed:\\nChange 1:\\n\\nThe Mayor’s proposal:\\xa0 A new 10,000-square foot threshold for design review project eligibility.\\xa0 That threshold would have removed a significant number of projects that the community should have input on. \\xa0Under the Mayor’s proposal 29% of projects currently subject to Design Review would have no longer received any design review at all.My amendment:\\xa0 10A in the table below reflects the changes to the proposed thresholds.\\xa0 Under this new proposal just 19% of projects that currently receive design review will no longer be subject to design review and 45% of all projects that currently receive design review will still receive Full Design Review.\\xa0 Many other projects will continue to receive Streamlined or Administrative Design Review.\\n\\nChange 2:\\n\\nThe Mayor’s proposal included both a Hybrid Design Review process and a Hybrid Pilot Project.\\xa0 No one seemed to like it, neither community members nor developers.My amendment:\\xa0 Removed the Hybrid Design Review Process and the Hybrid Pilot Project.\\n\\n\\nChange 3:\\n\\nThis amendment, derived by a suggestion from District 1 resident and Morgan Community Association President Deb Barker, was especially designed for projects in areas that are rezoned from single-family to LR1 and LR2. \\xa0I want to ensure that neighborhoods that are rezoned for greater density in the future will also have a greater say in how the new development occurs in their community. Areas that are rezoned from single-family to Low Rise 1 and Low Rise 2 and are between 5,000 and 8,000 square feet will go through Streamlined Design Review.\\xa0 Areas that are rezoned from single-family to Low Rise 3 and are between 5,000 and 8,000 square feet will go through Administrative Design Review.A description of the terms Streamlined Design Review, and Administrative Design Review can be found here.\\n\\nI appreciate all of the people who took the time to write to me and share their concerns about Design Review, I believe the process and your advocacy has led to a good compromise and a better proposal than what we saw from the Executive.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPublic Comment Now Open for the Accessory Dwelling Unit Environmental Review Process\\nThe city has begun the environmental review process to explore the potential impacts of removing barriers to building accessory dwelling units (ADUs). ADUs are small, secondary dwelling units inside, attached to, or in the yard of a single-family house.\\xa0 ADU’s include both attached and detached dwellings such as backyard cottages and separate but attached in-law apartments.\\xa0 The current proposal involves removing barriers to ADUs by eliminating the existing off-street parking and owner-occupancy requirements, and changing some development standards that regulate the size and location of backyard cottages.\\nThe City of Seattle is seeking public comment on the initial phase of the environmental review process.\\xa0 Public Comment will be accepted until 5:00pm on Wednesday November 1, 2017.\\xa0\\xa0 There are several ways that you can give input:\\n\\nonline http://www.seattle.gov/council/adu-eis\\nby email at ADUEIS@seattle.gov\\nby mail to Aly Pennucci, Council Central Staff, PO Box 34025, Seattle, WA 98124-4025\\nin person at our two public scoping meetings\\n\\nOctober 17, 2017, 6:00-7:30 p.m. at High Point Community Center, 6920 34th Ave SW\\nOctober 26, 2017, 6:00-7:30 p.m. at Hale’s Ales (in the Palladium), 4301 Leary Way NW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n {'link': 'http://council.seattle.gov/2015/10/21/more-sidewalks-for-less-money/',\n  'text': '\\n\\n\\nCouncilmember BurgessOctober 21, 2015January 6, 2023By Tim BurgessToday Mayor Murray and I announced new strategies to construct more sidewalks for less money. For decades, neighborhood advocates have pushed the City to provide sidewalks to the areas that have none, but the biggest hurdle has been cost. Traditional concrete sidewalks can cost $300,000 per block face. That’s a lot of money!\\nBut sidewalks are important. A lack of sidewalks makes it harder to access the amenities like parks and libraries that make Seattle a great place to live. It forces children to walk or bike in the street to reach our local schools. It creates dangerous situations for our neighbors with disabilities and our elderly neighbors.\\nSo several months ago I challenged the Department of Transportation to get more creative about sidewalk production; I wanted to see if the City could do more with the resources we have.\\nIt turns out we can.\\nBy using more cost-effective designs and materials, like stamped and stained asphalt instead of concrete, we can build more sidewalks for less money. This approach won’t make sense for every block, but by using it in appropriate places the City can build 250 sidewalks for the former price of 150. That is 67% more sidewalks, and many more neighbors who will now be able to safely walk to school, the park, the grocery store or the bus stop.\\nMore details are available here.\\n\\n'},\n {'link': 'https://council.seattle.gov/2022/12/13/councilmember-strauss-celebrates-legislation-to-exempt-design-review-for-affordable-housing-projects/',\n  'text': '\\n\\n\\nCouncilmember Mosqueda, Councilmember Strauss, Mosqueda, News Releases, StraussCouncilmember Strauss Celebrates Legislation to Exempt Design Review for Affordable Housing ProjectsDecember 13, 2022December 13, 2022By Joseph Peha\\nSEATTLE\\xa0–\\xa0Councilmember Dan Strauss\\xa0(District 6 – Northwest Seattle), Chair of the Land Use Committee, celebrated the unanimous City Council 9-0 vote today that extended COVID-19 era policies to support faster development of affordable rental housing production. Developed in partnership with Mayor Harrell and Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, this legislation called upon the SEPA Emergency to reduce cost and time for affordable housing developers by allowing them to opt-out of Design Review.\\xa0\\nThese changes were first passed by the Council on a one-year basis in April 2020 and were extended by the Council again in October 2020. These emergency regulations were set to expire on December 30, 2022, 60 days after the COVID-19 Emergency Proclamation ended. This interim legislation ensures that affordable housing projects continue to be exempted for an additional year.\\xa0\\n“This legislation speeds delivery and reduces costs of developing affordable housing. We will continue reforming Design Review to improve the program and streamline bureaucratic functions that slow our ability to bring housing online quickly,” said\\xa0Councilmember Strauss. “I have seen firsthand in my work addressing homelessness that when we have shelter availability, we are able to bring people off the streets. With adequate affordable housing, we reduce the time people spend in shelter and each shelter bed serves more people, meaning we bring more people off the streets. I am proud to work with Mayor Harrell and Councilmember Mosqueda on this important legislation.”\\xa0\\n“Creating more units of affordable housing is critical to sustainable progress on homelessness and to preventing displacement,” said\\xa0Mayor Bruce Harrell.\\xa0“This legislation will build on emergency policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic to remove barriers and support faster development of these needed projects. We have more work to do and will continue to advance immediate and long-term solutions to reduce bottlenecks and expand affordable housing options in our communities.”\\xa0\\n“In the midst of Seattle’s ongoing housing crisis and declared state of emergency on homelessness, we need to remove every barrier we can to bring more housing online as quickly as possible—especially when those barriers exist within our own city code. We have seen during the course of the pandemic that we can create high-quality housing that meets the diverse needs of our community without burdensome review processes that cause delays, create uncertainty, and drive up the costs of building housing. Thanks in large part to JumpStart, we are making historic investments into affordable housing—with over a half-billion dollars over the biennium in the budget we just passed—and I’m excited that we also have momentum to rework our city code and permitting processes to truly prioritize the housing our community desperately needs,” said\\xa0Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda\\xa0\\nCouncil Bill 120464\\xa0will extend the following interim regulations for up to one year: \\xa0\\n\\nAllow developments to opt-out of design review if at least 40 percent of units are affordable to households with income not greater than 60 percent of Area Median Income (AMI);\\xa0\\xa0\\nAuthorize the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections (SDCI) to waive or modify certain development standards for projects opting out of design review as a Type I (which means non-appealable) decision, if the waiver (1) does not impact the height, bulk and scale of the development and (2) results in more affordable units; and\\xa0\\xa0\\nApprove a work program for consideration of permanent changes to the Design Review Program.\\xa0\\n\\nDuring the one-year interim period that the temporary measures are in place, Councilmember Strauss and Mayor Harrell will work together to develop the legislation described below. The one-year interim period will be used to conduct a full SEPA review of those bills. If passed, the future bills would:\\xa0\\n\\nPermanently exempt affordable housing projects from design review.\\xa0\\nExempt housing projects that use the Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) program to produce their units\\xa0on-site\\xa0for a 2-year pilot.\\xa0\\nAllow all other housing projects to choose whether to participate in full design review or administrative design review as a 2-year pilot.\\xa0\\n\\n###\\n\\n\\nMore posts\\n\\nMay 14, 2024May 14, 2024\\nMayor Harrell Signs New Police Contract to Support Recruitment and Accountability After Council Passage\\n\\nToday, Mayor Bruce Harrell\\xa0signed a new contract with rank-and-file police officers into law following its passage by the City Council....\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 13, 2024May 13, 2024\\nSeattle Councilmember Morales calls for delay on police contract vote until community’s voice is heard\\n\\nSeattle City Councilmember Tammy J.

Now, it’s time for us elected leaders to step up and make sure they have everything they need to do their jobs better, faster, and more effectively.\\nI appreciate Mayor Harrell’s work on this framework for the levy and see we are in alignment on many key issues. The Council has a lot of hard work ahead of it to review and improve upon this proposal. I am ready and eager to lead that collaborative effort.”\\nToday’s announcement is a proposed framework for the levy. The Mayor’s Office is expected to transmit official legislation for the levy renewal in the coming weeks. At that point, it will be reviewed by a select committee chaired by Councilmember Saka.

Today Mayor Murray and Councilmember O’Brien announced their intention to significantly expand electric vehicle infrastructure in Seattle, such as charging stations, to encourage and serve the electric vehicle demand. The 30% by 2030 goal is the most ambitious target set by any United States city, intended to address the growing threat of climate change by reducing Seattle’s carbon footprint.\\nIn pursuit of this target, Mayor Murray announced his intention to include funds in his forthcoming 2017-18 City operating budget proposal to install 20 fast chargers for electric vehicles for public use, geographically spread throughout the city, making it easier for the public to transition to utilizing electric vehicles and geared towards equitable access. The Mayor’s budget proposal will also include $2.35 million for 150 new electric vehicle charging stations in the Seattle Municipal Tower, and for planning for installing additional infrastructure to support the City’s electric vehicle fleet. The City of Seattle has one of the largest electric vehicle fleets in the country with 80 fully electric vehicles, 17 plug-in hybrids, and over 500 conventional hybrid vehicles.\\nEncouraging the transition to electric vehicles is a critical piece of Seattle’s overall goals because road transportation makes up 66% of Seattle’s emissions, and emissions from vehicles account for nearly 50% percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Investments in transit, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure also support carbon emission reduction goals, like the recent voter-approved Move Seattle levy.\\nThe resolution also commits the Drive Clean Seattle Initiative to partner closely with the Mayor’s Equity and Environment Initiative to ensure wherever possible the City provide economic and clean air benefits of electric transportation to communities who are negatively impacted by air pollution and inequity.\\n“Seattle has and will continue to be a national leader in reducing carbon emissions,” said Mayor Ed Murray. “We created the Drive Clean Seattle Initiative earlier this year to accelerate the use of electric vehicles to move people, goods, and services across Seattle. We will build on this commitment in my 2017 budget by increasing our investments in electric vehicle infrastructure. I look forward to working with Councilmember O’Brien, City Council, environmental leaders and stakeholders as we continue to lead the way on addressing climate change.”\\nMayor Murray’s budget announcement and Council’s consideration of the 30% by 2030 resolution occurs during National Drive Electric Week, an event intended to raise awareness of the current availability of all-electric and hybrid vehicles on the market so commuters can consider driving electric.\\n“Dramatic action is necessary if we’re going to curb the threat of climate change, and electrifying the transportation system will make it easier for residents to reduce their carbon footprint, resulting in a larger global impact,” said Councilmember Mike O’Brien (District 6, Northwest Seattle). “With electric vehicles becoming more mainstream, they’ll only become more prolific. It’s up to the City to create the infrastructure to manage the coming wave of EVs.”\\nThe 30% by 2030 resolution endorses and builds upon the City’s Drive Clean Seattle Initiative, a comprehensive strategy to transition the transportation sector away from fossil fuels to use more of Seattle City Light’s carbon-neutral electricity. Mayor Murray’s proposed budget will include an investment to begin a 200-person pilot program to lower the initial cost and uncertainty of at-home charging in 2017.\\nThe resolution also endorses the “Half the Oil” plan, created by the Union of Concerned Scientists, to reduce petroleum use in the transportation sector by 50% by 2035.\\nThe resolution, unanimously approved by the Council’s Transportation Committee today, will be considered by Full Council on Monday, September 19 at 2 p.m.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrackbacks and Pingbacks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPingback: Electrifying Washington’s Transportation Future - WEC \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComment (1)\\n\\n\\nComments are closed.'},\n {'link': 'http://council.seattle.gov/2018/07/09/councilmember-mosquedas-statement-on-adoption-of-city-light-strategic-plan/',\n  'text': '\\n\\n\\nCouncilmember Mosqueda, Mosqueda, News ReleasesJuly 9, 2018January 6, 2023By City Council News ReleasesCouncilmember Teresa Mosqueda (Pos. 8 – Citywide) and Chair of the Housing, Health, Energy and Workers’ Rights Committee, issued the following statement in response to the Seattle City Council passage of Resolution 31819 adopting the 2019-2024 Seattle City Light Strategic Plan.\\n“Today’s 8-1 vote adopted the Seattle City Light Strategic Plan and the rate path proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan and includes a request from the Mayor to transmit a rate path, including an average 4.5% rate increase over the next six years – averaging about $3.77 per month for the typical residential customer in 2019. These rate increases are lower than what was originally proposed by City Light, thanks to the great advocacy of the all-volunteer City Light Review Panel, and tasks the Review Panel with preparing recommendations for rate design changes for the first time in decades thanks to the work of Councilmember Mosqueda, who chaired the Strategic Plan Select Committee.\\n“As part of the Strategic Plan, City Light will work to reduce the costs associated with large capital projects, as well as Operations and Maintenance costs, with a priority on promoting good, living-wage jobs, workforce stability, and continuing to deliver affordable and clean electricity to customers while maintaining worker safety. Highlights include the Council-added initiative to meaningfully address workplace culture concerns, particularly with respect to gender- and race-based harassment, and fear of retaliation among staff; operationalizing institutional memory, so when workers retire, we don’t lose their knowledge of how the utility operates; and a continued emphasis on energy and nature conservation, ensuring that Seattle City Light remains the Nation’s greenest utility.”\\nThe resolution sponsored by Councilmember Mosqueda also requests that the Review Panel, in collaboration with key community partners and industry experts, begin work this fall on updating how rates are designed and structured, and make recommendations to more equitably apply rates beginning next Summer.\\n“Rate Design hasn’t been significantly updated since the 1980’s, and this work is long overdue,” Mosqueda continued. The chair said she hopes the Rate Design review process will keep conservation at the forefront, while examining financial policies, and providing Council with the information necessary to update the rate path and consider additional changes in 2019 to ease the impacts of these rate increases on working families and small businesses.\\n“Through ongoing oversight and collaboration, I look forward to setting a new standard for good governance and engagement with the Review Panel and community, one that ensures City Light is held accountable, while continuing to deliver the best service possible to its customers,” added Mosqueda. “My team will continue to be engaged at a heighted level with City Light, the Mayor’s office, colleagues, and the community at large, to\\xa0reign\\xa0in costs, reduce overruns, and address the Rate Design changes needed to make sure City Light can continue to grow into the Public Utility of the Future!”\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n'},\n {'link': 'http://council.seattle.gov/2018/08/13/seattle-city-council-confirms-carmen-best-as-seattle-police-chief/',\n  'text': '\\n\\n\\nCouncilmember González, Gonzalez, News ReleasesAugust 13, 2018January 6, 2023By Joseph PehaToday the Seattle City Council – by a unanimous\\xa0vote – confirmed Carmen Best as Chief of Police for the Seattle Police Department during its regularly scheduled City Council meeting.\\nCouncilmember M.

More than 60 candidates applied to be Seattle’s Chief of Police. \\n“I have seen firsthand the love and compassion that Chief Best shows for both the community and the Seattle Police Department,” said Mayor Jenny Durkan. “Throughout her 26 years with the SPD, she has worked her way up the ranks gaining the respect of the community and rank-and-file officers.

For a detailed breakdown of the add-in budget items I sponsored, please click here.\\n“I fought hard and won big. What follows are selected highlights for District 5:\\n\\nShelter for unhoused residents near Lake City\\nPedestrian safety improvements and additional sidewalks on and near Aurora Avenue\\nPlanning and design work for the future Bitter Lake Reservoir Park\\nEstablishment of Literacy Source’s Ready to Work program in Lake City\\nService Navigators at food banks including North Helpline\\nSidewalk construction in the Meadowbrook neighborhood\\nPlanning for additional affordable housing in Northgate\\nEvents and performances to activate our parks\\nLow barrier services for survivors of commercial sexual exploitation near Aurora Avenue\\n\\n“In addition, we added funding for expansion of the 13th Year Scholarship program to North Seattle College, supported successful transitional housing programs, paid for citywide community planning for siting affordable housing, and provided more space for child care programs.\\n“These achievements and many others we made during this budget were made possible because local organizations and constituents voiced their support for these critical improvements.
